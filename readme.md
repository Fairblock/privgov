# Quickstart - Fairblock Module Integration with Cosmos Chains


Welcome to the Fairblock <> Cosmos Integration Tutorial. Please note that the App Quickstart within the [Fairblock docs](https://docs.fairblock.network/docs/welcome/quickstart/cosmos_chain) is the exact same content as this README. They are placed in different locations for convenience to the reader.


> ‼️ All code within this tutorial is purely educational, and it is up to the readers discretion to build their applications following industry standards, practices, and applicable regulations.


A walk through of this tutorial, alongside context on Fairblock, EVMs, and Cosmos Chains is provided in the video below. If you prefer learning by reading on your own, feel free to skip it and continue onward in this README!

The first goal of this tutorial is to showcase the high level options to integrate Fairblock into Cosmos Chains using the respective FairyKit.


## Cosmos Integration


At a high-level, a key design decision for which FairyKit method to choose revolves around the Decryption and Execution Layer.


Chains integrating with Fairblock can often choose between the "FairyKit" or "Co-Processing" route, as shown in the below schematic, where the two high-level integration categories, FairyKit and Coprocessing, are described. Depending on the design scenario, one method will prove to be better suited than the other.


A key aspect to note is that all of these integration methods provide the functionality to interact with Fairyring, and there can be underlying application logic working with these integrations. Today's tutorial covers a subset of the FairyKit methods available for Cosmos integration with Fairblock. Specifically, it is a combination of the underlying application logic and a mixture of the `x/pep` module details, that collectively construct today's `privgov` integration package.

At a more granular level, Cosmos FairyKit integrates using the following one or more of the following methods:


1. Module Integration
2. Smart Contract Integration
3. Underlying Execution Logic Integration
4. A Combination of Any of the Above


These four methods can each be used to implement app logic integrating with FairyRing, even the application of interest today, `privgov`.


## An Intro to `privgov`


In today's tutorial, we will be covering the usage of `privgov`, a blockchain built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint, and a mixture of the `x/pep` module created with [Ignite CLI](https://ignite.com/cli). It is a basic working cosmos chain that uses the Fairblock/cosmos-sdk to enable private governance.


Governance is an important aspect within blockchains. In the Cosmos ecosystems, we can see challenges with today's solutions including:


- Colluding parties
- Social and monetary pressures for people to vote a certain way


The `privgov` repo was created to showcase an easy-to-use solution to incorporate truly fair, and credible governance systems. Using `privgov` in a Cosmos chain enables encrypted voting, getting these systems closer to true democracy.


> The core code outlined in the next section can be incorporated into your own Cosmos chain such that `privgov` enables encrypted voting.


## Integrating `privgov` into a Cosmos SDK Project


The core logic for `privgov` can be incorporated into your own Cosmos SDK project by following these steps.


1. Add the following in the `replace` clause of your `go.mod` file:


```go
replace (
   cosmossdk.io/api => github.com/FairBlock/cosmossdk-api v0.7.5


   github.com/99designs/keyring => github.com/cosmos/keyring v1.2.0
   // use cosmos fork of keyring
   github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd => github.com/FairBlock/wasmd v0.50.6-fairyring
   github.com/Fairblock/fairyring => github.com/FairBlock/fairyring v0.10.2


   github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk => github.com/Fairblock/cosmos-sdk v0.50.8-fairyring-2
   // dgrijalva/jwt-go is deprecated and doesn't receive security updates.
   github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go => github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4 v4.4.2
   // Fix upstream GHSA-h395-qcrw-5vmq and GHSA-3vp4-m3rf-835h vulnerabilities.
   github.com/gin-gonic/gin => github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.9.1
   github.com/gogo/protobuf => github.com/regen-network/protobuf v1.3.3-alpha.regen.1
)
```


<details>
<summary>`go.mod` Change Details and Reasoning</summary>


The reasoning for each of the above changes made within the `go.mod` file include:
- `cosmossdk-api v0.7.5` —> we replaced it with our fork of the API, because the other one is not maintained well. The version that comes with the default backend is backdated, and typically had to update it manually for our case.
- `keyring v1.2.0` —> there's a bug in the keyring repo. We are using a different fork by cosmos themselves and we are just replacing it with this specific version.
- wasmd, fairyring, cosmos-sdk - Fairyring specific
   - `wasmd v0.50.6-fairyring`
   - The default `wasmd` has dependencies on the default gov module.
   - Now, `wasmd` has dependencies on the priv-vgov module. since it is a modified gov module.
   - need to replace the wasmd module with the fairyring one.
- `fairyring v0.10.2`
   - Within `go.mod`, under direct dependencies, there is already a dependency plotted for `faiyring`. We have put the replace clause here because it is easier to maintain the proper version.
- `cosmos-sdk v0.50.8-fairyring-2`
   - This is the most important change where the existing default `cosmos-sdk` is replaced with the fairblock fork.
   - default sdk module don't have IBC capabilities as well and do not have support for encrypted votes, processing them, etc. The Fairblock organization forked the SDK repo (and maintains it), took the gov module and made the changes / added functionalities over there. It cannot be merged with the official SDK repo.
- `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4 v4.4.2`
   - If you are running an SDK chain, this should be there, the default specified one has a bug.
- `gin v1.9.1`
   - we’re not changing any repo here. Easier to set because gin has frequent bugs, so it’s handy to update the version this way if it is required ever.
- `protobuf v1.3.3-alpha.regen.1`
   - Fairyring is using certain clauses that are not supported by the default gogo/protobuf.


> NOTE: if there are instances where a SDK chain is using a fork of something that then conflicts with our fork, then they’ll need to have changes made to their fork accordingly too.
</details>




2. The custom `gov` module has to be registered with the IBC router. To do that, simply add the route in the `app/ibc.go` file:


```go
   // Add gov module to IBC Router
   govIBCModule := ibcfee.NewIBCMiddleware(gov.NewIBCModule(app.GovKeeper), app.IBCFeeKeeper)
   ibcRouter.AddRoute(govtypes.ModuleName, govIBCModule)


   app.IBCKeeper.SetRouter(ibcRouter)
```


> The route must be added to the `ibcrouter` before calling the `SetRouter()` function


That's it! You now should have the `privgov` functionality incorporated into your cosmos chain. Now we will continue with the tutorial to test and showcase the `privgov` in action.


## Setting up the test environment


To set up the testing environment, simply run the `priv_gov_setup.sh` file and follow along with the prompts. The script does the following things:


1. Sets up and starts the fairying chain (with all its bells and whistles)
2. Sets up and starts the `privgov` chain
3. Creates a IBC channel between the fairyring chain and privgov chain and starts the Hermes relayer


> It is recommended to use a short time frame for quick iterative tests, such as `4m`, which represents 4 minutes.


## ℹ️ For MacOS Systems


If you are operating on a MacOS system, you may need to carry out the following installations to ensure that this tutorial works with your machine:


1. Make sure to install `ignite`, `hermes`, and `rust` onto your machine. Download link and instructions for each are listed below (these assume you have `homebrew` installed):
   - [`ignite`](https://docs.ignite.com/welcome/install)
   - [`hermes`](https://hermes.informal.systems/quick-start/installation.html#install-by-downloading)
   - [`rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. bash version: this tutorial requires an updated bash version compared to the default MacOS 3.x version. If it’s less than 4.x then the script will exit.


It is up to you to install a higher version in a way that works for you. For example, one of our devs simply had an updated version of bash installed elsewhere, and used that to run it. For them, they then had to use the updated bash version as per its specific file location:


```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/bash ./priv_gov_setup.sh
```


instead of just running


```bash
./priv_gov_setup.sh
```


3. Use `go` version 1.22.10. If you need to have multiple versions of `go` installed on your local machine, check out this [link](https://go.dev/doc/manage-install#installing-multiple) from the `go` docs.


```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/bash ./priv_gov_setup.sh go1.22.10
```


## Proposal and Voting


A governance proposal can be created by executing the tx `privgovd tx gov submit-proposal [path-to-proposal-file] --from [user] --chain-id privgov`. A sample proposal file can be found in `draft_proposal.json`.


So to start the governance process, make a governance proposal by running the following command:


```bash
privgovd tx gov submit-proposal draft_proposal.json --from fred --chain-id privgov
```


> ℹ️ When specifying the from user, or users in general throughout this tutorial, do not use `bob`. This user has some problematic aspects that can cause the tutorial to not run, and has been seen in other cosmos sdk chain tests.


Once the proposal is created, query the proposal to assess its details. You can now get the unique identity and pubkey for the proposal.


```bash
privgovd q gov proposals
```


![Proposal Example](./assets/NewProposal.png)


You can then use the `encrypt-vote` functionality to encrypt your vote. Use the bash command and details from querying the proposal, such as the `identity`, and `pubkey` to submit the tx:


```bash
fairyringd encrypt-vote yes <identity> <random salt> <pubkey>
```


An example of the command you would use should look like this, but with different identities, salts, and pubkeys.


```bash
fairyringd encrypt-vote yes 1/rq 1234 b5b8a299700e44ae0b0ffb54903a253555f60babdf0d3ceddac4253840a92ac9511d8a236efe2db2d518e9dbb50ea973
```


Now that you have encrypted your 'yes' vote, and have a resultant ciphertext, you can now vote on the respective proposal. Run the following command with appropriate vars from your proposal query.


```bash
privgovd tx gov vote-encrypted [proposal-id] [encrypted data]
```


An example of the command you would use should look like this, but with different proposal-ids, and encrypted data.


```bash
privgovd tx gov vote-encrypted 1 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 --from alice
--chain-id privgov
```


Once the vote is submitted, wait for the voting period to be over and the votes to be tallied. You can query the proposal whenever to see the proposal status, again by using:


```bash
privgovd q gov proposals
```


Once the voting period has ended, the proposal final status will be hit. It will either be FAIL or SUCCESS. If you voted 'yes', then the proposal should have passed.
